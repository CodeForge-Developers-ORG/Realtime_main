    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how {{CompanyName}} (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses,
      discloses, and protects personal data—including <strong>biometric information</strong>—when you
      use our real-time biometric solutions (the “Services”), our websites, and related products.
      By accessing or using the Services, you agree to this Policy.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <strong>Quick summary</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>We collect only what’s needed to verify identity and operate the Service.</li>
        <li>Biometric templates are created from inputs (e.g., fingerprint, face, voice) and are never stored as raw images/audio unless explicitly required and permitted.</li>
        <li>We don’t sell personal data. We share it only with your consent, to provide the Service, or as required by law.</li>
        <li>You can request access, correction, deletion, or withdrawal of consent subject to applicable law.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Biometric Inputs &amp; Templates:</strong> Fingerprint/face/voice inputs processed to generate mathematical templates for authentication. Where possible, we discard raw inputs after template creation.</li>
      <li><strong>Identity &amp; Account Data:</strong> Name, email, phone, role, organization, login credentials, identifiers (user ID, device ID).</li>
      <li><strong>Usage &amp; Device Data:</strong> Logs, timestamps, IP address, browser/device info, app version, diagnostics, and performance metrics.</li>
      <li><strong>Transactional Data:</strong> Subscription details, purchase history, and support interactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies &amp; Similar Tech:</strong> See “Cookies” below for details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Authenticate users and provide real-time biometric verification.</li>
      <li>Prevent fraud, detect anomalies, and maintain security.</li>
      <li>Operate, maintain, and improve the Services (including analytics and quality assurance).</li>
      <li>Provide customer support and communicate important updates.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Legal Basis (Where Applicable)</h2>

      <li><strong>Legitimate Interests / Legal Obligation:</strong> Security, fraud prevention, and compliance (as permitted by law).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Biometric Data Practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We strive to process biometric inputs <em>ephemerally</em> and store only derived templates where feasible.</li>
      <li>Templates are stored using encryption at rest and in transit.</li>
      <li>Access to biometric data is strictly role-based and logged.</li>
      <li>We do not use biometric data for purposes unrelated to identity verification without your explicit consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy
      (e.g., for the duration of your account or contract) and as required by law. When no longer
      needed, we delete or de-identify data using reasonable measures. Organization admins may
      request earlier deletion subject to legal/contractual constraints.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Cloud hosting, analytics, support tools—bound by confidentiality and data processing terms.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>7. International Transfers</h2>

      contractual clauses and technical controls to protect your data consistent with applicable law.

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest.</li>

      <li>Secure development lifecycle, vulnerability management, and incident response procedures.</li>
      <li>User responsibilities: maintain strong credentials and report suspected compromise.</li>
    </ul>
